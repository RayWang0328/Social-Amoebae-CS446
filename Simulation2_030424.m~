%This simulation updates our previous mechanism by having a starvation
%threshold for the amount of food available in the system, at which point
%clustering begins. Amoeba clusters locate eachother and combine using 
%pythagorean methods (this will be updated to chemical diffusion later in research),
%increasing amoeba concentration in each available grid area in the cell.
%Addtionally, updates to previous visualization are made using a more
%biologically reflective colormap that increases green intensity based on
%concentration of amoebas.
